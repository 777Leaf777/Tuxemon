Tools to get/manipulate game files or config should go here.

* Scripts should have documentation at the top of the file
* Scripts do not need to be python
* Do not modify project if your script is another language; scripts should stand alone
* Do not add script dependencies to requirements.txt or setup.py
* New python scripts should be written for python 3.6+
* Scripts do not require unit testing

If you are writing a script which is a requirement to play the game, then do
not write a script.  The game should be playable without the use of scripts.
